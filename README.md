The Odin Project - Foundations - Project: Recipes


Tue Dec 14 3:26
This is the first project I will be taking on with the Odin Project. The focus will specifically be on HTML. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to build simple websites, and organizing projects in a portfolio that is shareable to GitHub. I intend on returning to this README to update on my progress and reflect on what I have learned.

Completed the first project within 2 hours. HTML is pretty straightforward! I had a little trouble with organization and best practices, but managed (hopefully) to format the document well and check my code in W3C. The biggest mistake I found was trying to put my header within the lists. This isn't allowed in W3C. I found the best way to do it was to create sections that contain the list and header. 

Other than that, I believe I could use more practice staging and committing to github. I did it frequently whenever I thought I made a meaningful change, and tried to write clean messages when committing, but could potentially use some more guidance on it.

The Odin Project - Foundations - Project: Recipes


Tue Dec 14 3:26
This is the first project I will be taking on with the Odin Project. The focus will specifically be on HTML. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to build simple websites, and organizing projects in a portfolio that is shareable to GitHub. I intend on returning to this README to update on my progress and reflect on what I have learned.
